##Notes

GitHub is awesome and a fun time. Had a hard time figuring out VS Code and git, but YouTube is very handy. Some notes about GitHub:
-GitHub stores and shares my repositories online. To prevent merge errors, I should do most of my editing in VS
-git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
-git config --global user.name "Your name"
-**clones** allow you to edit your repository remotely
-**forks** are for experimenting with other people's code and creating varients of it
-**pull**, **add**, **commit**, **push**
-use branches: keeps code safe and allows you to retrace steps
