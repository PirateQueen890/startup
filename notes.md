# Notes

## GitHub
GitHub is awesome and a fun time. Had a hard time figuring out VS Code and git, but YouTube is very handy. Some notes about GitHub:
- GitHub stores and shares my repositories online. To prevent merge errors, I should do most of my editing in VS
- git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
- git config --global user.name "Your name"
- **clones** allow you to edit your repository remotely
- **forks** are for experimenting with other people's code and creating varients of it
- **pull**, **add**, **commit**, **push**
- use branches: keeps code safe and allows you to retrace steps
